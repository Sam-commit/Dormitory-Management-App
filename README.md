## Future Scopes of This Project

Other Features that we can add and we will are:

- Adding Hostels and Deleting Hostels for Admin convenience.
- ImagePicker so that users and admins can set their Profile Picture.
- Payment Section: More detailed backend is required for this, and we can implement that.
- Search Functionality in Student Record, In normal use, if there are many students, this feature may be of great Use.

And of course reviews from Others are always welcome to Improve our App.
